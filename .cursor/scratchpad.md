# Swiss Cart Online Shop Project

## Background and Motivation
This is a React-based online shop application for Brings(gobrings.ch), featuring a delivery service with location-based delivery times and a product catalog including beverages, snacks, and age-restricted items. The project is built using Vite, TypeScript, React, shadcn-ui, Tailwind CSS, and Supabase for backend. The goal is to get the app live by tomorrow, focusing on linking products from Supabase, managing the checkout process, and creating an admin dashboard.

## Key Challenges and Analysis
1. **Supabase Integration**: The project has Supabase set up but needs to ensure products are properly linked/stored in the database.
2. **Checkout Process**: The checkout flow needs to be completed and optimized for a smooth user experience.
3. **Admin Dashboard**: An admin dashboard exists but may need optimization for product management and order tracking.
4. **Time Constraint**: With a deadline of tomorrow, we need to prioritize essential features.
5. **Age Verification**: The app includes age-restricted products that require proper verification.
6. **Deployment Readiness**: Need to ensure the app is ready for deployment with proper environment setup.
7. **Data Initialization**: Product data needs to be properly initialized in Supabase.

## Current Status / Progress Tracking
- Task 1.1 (Verify Supabase connection): ✅ COMPLETED
  - The environment variables have been properly set in .env.local
  - The app connects successfully to Supabase

- Task 1.2 (Check product schema in Supabase): ✅ COMPLETED
  - Reviewed the `create_products_table.sql` file which defines the schema
  - Created a diagnostic utility (`supabase-diagnostic.ts`) to check database connectivity and product table status
  - Enhanced the DatabaseDiagnostic page to use our new utility
  - The product table schema is well-defined with the following fields:
    - id (UUID, primary key)
    - product_id (VARCHAR, unique)
    - name (VARCHAR)
    - description (TEXT)
    - price (DECIMAL)
    - image (VARCHAR)
    - category (VARCHAR)
    - subcategory (VARCHAR)
    - is_age_restricted (BOOLEAN)
    - is_featured (BOOLEAN)
    - inventory_count (INTEGER)
    - created_at/updated_at (TIMESTAMP)

- Task 1.3 (Validate product initialization): ✅ COMPLETED
  - Discovered a discrepancy between the expected schema and the actual database schema
  - The Supabase schema has fields like `agerestricted` instead of `is_age_restricted`
  - Updated the product adapter (`product-adapter.ts`) to correctly map between app product and database product types
  - Created a force initialization utility (`force-product-init.ts`) to clear and recreate products in Supabase
  - Updated the DatabaseDiagnostic page with a "Force Initialize Products" button
  - Products can now be successfully initialized in Supabase with the correct schema

- Task 1.4 (Fix any issues with product image storage): ✅ COMPLETED
  - Created image storage utilities (`image-storage-init.ts`) to:
    - Check if the 'product-images' bucket exists and create it if it doesn't
    - Ensure the bucket has public access permissions
    - Upload a placeholder image for products without specific images
  - Added an "Initialize Image Storage" button to the DatabaseDiagnostic page
  - The page now displays the placeholder image URL and a preview after initialization
  - With these changes, product images can now be properly stored and retrieved from Supabase

- Task 2.1 (Review existing checkout flow): ✅ COMPLETED
  - The checkout process is implemented with a multi-step form using react-hook-form and zod validation
  - The checkout flow consists of two steps:
    1. **Address Entry**: Collects customer contact and delivery information
    2. **Payment Selection**: Allows users to choose a payment method (currently only cash is available)
  - Cart data is managed through a CartContext and persisted in localStorage
  - The checkout process supports:
    - Cart validation (prevents checkout with empty cart)
    - Automatic user account creation for guest checkouts
    - Storing orders in the Supabase 'orders' table
    - Storing order items in the 'order_items' table
    - Applying delivery fees based on order total (free for orders over CHF 50)
    - Applying discounts from the AuthContext (10% discount)
  - The OrderConfirmation page shows the order ID and estimated delivery time
  - Key areas for improvement:
    1. Limited payment options (only cash is active, card and TWINT are disabled)
    2. No address saving and retrieval for logged-in users
    3. Basic delivery time estimation not based on district information
    4. No order status tracking functionality

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests
After reviewing the checkout process, I've identified several areas for improvement:

1. **Address Saving**: When a user is logged in, their previous addresses are not loaded or saved for future use, which would improve the checkout experience. We should implement functionality to save and retrieve user addresses from the 'user_addresses' table in Supabase (Task 2.3).

2. **District-Based Delivery Time**: Currently, there's a static delivery time estimation that doesn't account for the user's district, which is mentioned as a key feature in the requirements. We should implement district-specific delivery time calculations (Task 2.4).

3. **Payment Integration**: The payment options are limited, with only cash payments being available. While full payment integration might be beyond the immediate scope, we should ensure the checkout process works smoothly with the cash option.

The next step is to fix any bugs in the checkout process (Task 2.2) before moving on to address saving and delivery time estimation.

## Lessons
- When working with Supabase, proper bucket initialization is critical for image storage.
- Check both the product initialization and image storage functionality to ensure the app works correctly.
- Using a diagnostic utility helps quickly identify issues with database connectivity and table structure.
- Pay close attention to field naming in the database schema vs. what's expected in the code - Supabase doesn't strictly follow camelCase vs. snake_case conventions.
- Using TypeScript's utility types (like Required<Pick<...>>) can help enforce the correct shape of data when inserting into Supabase.
- Always ensure storage buckets are properly configured with public access when needed for image serving.
- React hook form with zod validation provides a robust way to handle form validation in a checkout process.
- Multi-step forms improve user experience by breaking down complex checkout processes into manageable steps.
