# District Feature Implementation Guide

This guide outlines the complete implementation of the district feature in the Swift Swiss Cart application.

## 1. Database Update

First, you need to add the district column to the orders table in your Supabase database:

1. Log in to your Supabase project dashboard
2. Go to the SQL Editor in the left-hand menu
3. Create a new query
4. Copy and paste the following SQL:

```sql
-- Add district column to orders table
ALTER TABLE orders ADD COLUMN district TEXT;

-- Add comment to explain the column
COMMENT ON COLUMN orders.district IS 'The delivery district selected by the customer';
```

5. Click "Run" to execute the SQL

## 2. Code Changes Made

The following files have been updated to implement the district feature:

### a. Checkout Component

The Checkout component now:
- Verifies that a district is selected before proceeding to payment
- Verifies that a district is selected before submitting an order
- Includes the district in the order data saved to Supabase

### b. Order Test Page

The OrderTestPage component now includes the district in test orders created through it.

### c. OrderDetails Component

The OrderDetails component now displays the district information in the delivery address section of order details.

### d. Order Type Definition

The Order interface in `src/types/order.ts` has been updated to include the district field.

## 3. User Experience

The district feature enhances the user experience by:

1. Requiring users to select a district before proceeding with checkout
2. Showing a district selection modal if no district is selected
3. Storing the selected district with the order for reference during delivery

## 4. Testing the Implementation

To test that the district feature is working properly:

1. Try placing an order without selecting a district - you should be prompted to select one
2. Complete an order with a district selected - check that it saves to the database
3. View an order in the admin panel - verify the district is displayed correctly

## 5. Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

- Verify the district column was added to the orders table
- Check browser console for any errors during checkout
- Ensure the DistrictContext is properly accessible in the Checkout component
- Verify that orders are being created with the district field in the Supabase database

## 6. Future Enhancements

Consider these future enhancements for the district feature:

1. Adding district-based delivery fee calculations
2. Creating district-specific product availability
3. Adding district filtering in the admin order tracking view
4. Implementing district-based delivery time estimates
